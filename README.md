Show your work to earn full credit. Do all problems using the methods discussed in class.
1.                Estimate   the   area   under   the   graph   of   y      =   2√x   from x = 0 to x = 4 using   four   approximating   rectangles   and   (a)   left   endpoints   and (b) right endpoints. Round your answers to four   decimal places.
2.                Use the limit definition of   the integral   to   evaluate the   integral.

3.             Use Part   1   of   the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to   find the   derivative   of   the   function   and   simplify.

4.                Find the general indefinite integral and   simplify. (Use C for the   constant   of   integration.)

5.                The velocity function   (in meters per second)   is   given   for   a particle moving   along   a   line.
v(t)   =   t2 −   3t   −   15, 0 ≤   t   ≤   7
(a)       Find   the   displacement.
(b)      Find the distance traveled by the particle during the given time interval.
6.                Evaluate the definite   integral by interpreting it   as   areas. Include   a   graph

7.                Evaluate   the   indefinite   integral.
8.                Evaluate   the   definite   integral.

*For problems 9 and   10. The displacement (in meters) of   a particle   moving   in   a   straight   line   is   given   by s = t2    - 9t +   19, where t is   measured   in   seconds. 
9.                Find the average velocity over the specified   time   intervals. 
(a)         [4, 4.5] 
(b)      [4,4.1] 
10.          Use the limit definition of   a derivative to   find   a   formula for   the   instantaneous   velocity   at   any   time   t.   Find   the   instantaneous   velocity   when t = 4. 
11.    Find the derivative of   the function and   find   all   critical numbers. 
f(x)   =   (x   + 4)2   (2x   −   5)2 
12.          Find dy/dx by   implicit   differentiation. 
ex/y =   8x - y 
13.          A box with an open top is to   be constructed   from   a   square piece   of   cardboard,   3   ft.   wide, by   cutting   out   a   square   from   each   of   the four corners and bending up the   sides.
(a) Write an expression for the volume V in   terms   of x.
(b)    Find   the   largest   volume   that   such   a   box   can   have.
